# ios voip softphone dialer


If you want to develop a ios voip softphone from scatch, you can use this project. <br>
It has a sip library written in objective c, where registration mesagges are implemented. <br>
Feel free to extend this library.<br><br>

First clone this repository then set your sip server ip, port, username and password in "SipServerInfo.plist" file.<br>



#### Technologies:
Framework: MVC Architechture.<br>
Protocol: SIP(RFC 3261) , UDP<br>
Encryption Digest: MD5<br>
Language: Objective c.<br><br>

Usually, you will find lots of open source SIP libraies such as pjsip, linphone, jsSip etc. But there architechture is too much complex <br>
for initial or basic development. In future, I will include audio codec such as G729 & G711 and RTP in this project.<br><br>

If you dont know the basics of SIP protocol, i suggest you go to this link.<br>

For more information, please go through the project and feel free to create an issue for any misunderstading.
